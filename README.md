# Nico Strife

## Concept of the Game
Nico Strife is a 3D platformer and shooter. The game is based on Nico Strife, who lives a regular
life, but as soon as he falls asleep at night, he has dreams that reflect how his day went. If he
had a good day, then his dream is vibrant and bright, but when he has a bad day, his dreams
are dark and vivid.
The game will feature a system of levels that are determined by how Nico’s day went. A worse
day means harsher enemies and an aggressive Nico. A better day means a more colorful (but
still challenging) level with fewer enemies and a friendlier gun that poofs them rather than kills
them, for example. The player will also have an optional collectible of pages out of Nico’s diary
for that specific day.
The user will play through the dreams of Nico, where Nico’s day determines how the level will
look and play. Victory is when a player finishes a level and proceeds to the next day of Nico’s
life.

## Steps Installing the Game
Download the nico_strife_0.0.1.exe and nico_strife_0.0.1.pck folder, then run the exe file. Installation of Godot Game Engine may be needed for the file to run.


## Controls
Use WASD for direction input. Hover the mouse to look around the x-axis and redirect
the character. Press shift to sprint. Press space to jump; double press for double jump. If the
player falls off a platform, press L to respawn from the beginning, or P to exit the game.

## Walkthrough
Make it past the first few platforms until you reach the elevating platform. Stay on the
elevating platform until the model is able to jump onto the next. Keep going straight until the
model encounters a wall with platforms on it. Use the platforms to make it to the top of the wall
and jump across the tiny platforms next to the floating hotel until the model reaches the hallway.
After the hallway is cleared while being cautious of the gaps in the ground, drop down onto the
next large platform and take the steps to the next obstacle. Here, the player has two choices:
Take the bridge with the moving spheres, or jump the tiny orange obstacles from under the
bridge. Once the player successfully gets past, there is one more jump to perform before they
are greeted with a winning screen in-game.
